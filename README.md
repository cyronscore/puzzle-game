If you're looking somewhere for a link to the project (yes, it does exist) you won't find it here. The place I am hosting it charges people to have private projects, and why would I do that when I can just *not tell people where it is?* Yeah, the files are here. I just need a place to manage my progess, and there are quite a bit of solutions here to uncommon problems you might face when developing your project. I did manage to confuse the developers of the website that I'm hosting it on a few times, actually.
